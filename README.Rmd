The {svAssert} package provides tools for defensive programming in R, with fast, but versatile assertions partly based on {checkmate}. When an assertion fails, it works hard to issue meaningful and rich-formatted error messages (thanks to `rlang::abort()` and `cli::cli_abort()`). These message can be easily translated in other natural languages. {svAssert} can even translate messages in other packages after they are thrown.

## Installation

{svAssert} is not available from CRAN yet. You should install it from the [SciViews R-Universe](https://sciviews.r-universe.dev). To install this package and its dependencies, run the following command in R:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages('svAssert', repos = c('https://sciviews.r-universe.dev',
  'https://cloud.r-project.org'))
```

You can also install the latest development version of {svAssert} from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("SciViews/svAssert")
```

R should install all required dependencies automatically, and then it should compile and install {svAssert}.
